## Features

- üîç **File Scanner**: Search across SharePoint sites for potentially sensitive files based on customizable keywords and patterns
- üó∫Ô∏è **Site Access Recon**: Identify all SharePoint sites accessible to authenticated accounts
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Write Permission Analysis**: Detect SharePoint spaces where the authenticated account has write access
- üçØ **Honeytoken Deployment**: Automatically deploy customizable honey tokens across writable SharePoint spaces

## Prerequisites

- Python
- SharePoint Online Access
- Appropriate SharePoint permissions for deployment of decoys
- [Office365-REST-Python-Client](https://github.com/vgrem/Office365-REST-Python-Client) library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pwnpy/ShareSentry.git
cd ShareSentry
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:

You need to have one of the following OS env variables for authentication

For Username/Password Authentication:
```env
SHAREPOINT_USERNAME=your_username@domain.com
SHAREPOINT_PASSWORD=your_password
```

For Azure App Authentication:
```env
AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
AZURE_THUMBPRINT=your_certificate_thumbprint
AZURE_TENANT=your_tenant_id
```
The Certificate file path will be taken as inputs from the user

# Configuration
## KQL queries
The script will scan for a series of predefined queries aimed at identifying sensitive content. These queries are customizable and can be tailored to your organization's needs in the [queries](queries.md) file.


## Honey Tokens (decoys) setup
You can add or remove different honey tokens type of files and customise the wordlists file names from the `scripts/deploy_honeytokens.py` script.

### Wordlists (file naming)
Modify the keyword files in the `wordlists/` directory to customize decoy file names to your naming convention, for e.g.,
- `archive_filenames.txt`:  Archive file patterns
- `API_filenames.txt`: API related configuration files
- `config_filenames.txt`: Configuration file patterns
- `document_filenames.txt`: Documents (.docx, pdf, etc...) files
- ... (and other wordlist files)

### Templates
Customize honey token templates in the `templates/` directory:
```
templates/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ template.bak
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ template.conf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ template.csv
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (other templates)
```

## Usage

1. Run the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```

2. Choose your authentication method:
```
Choose authentication method:
1. Username/Password
2. Azure App
```

3. Select operation mode:
```
Select an option:
1. Scan SharePoint for sensitive files
2. Identify all SharePoint sites the account is a member of
3. Check write permissions on identified SharePoint sites
4. Deploy honeytokens
5. Exit
```

## Output Files

The tool generates several output files:
```
output/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deployed_tokens.txt    # Log of deployed decoys assets
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ writable_spaces.txt    # Sites with write access
logs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ audit.log # Audit logs
```
